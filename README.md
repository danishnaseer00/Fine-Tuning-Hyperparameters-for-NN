# 🔧 Hyperparameter Tuning for Neural Networks

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on exploring hyperparameter tuning techniques for improving the performance of neural networks. It utilizes `Keras` and `TensorFlow`, along with tuning tools such as `KerasTuner`, to find optimal configurations for building and training deep learning models.

## 📘 Overview

Hyperparameter tuning is a crucial step in developing robust and high-performing deep learning models. In this notebook, we:

- Build a baseline neural network model using Keras
- Tune model architecture and training parameters using **Keras Tuner**
- Evaluate performance using validation accuracy
- Visualize results to analyze the impact of different hyperparameter combinations
