## Hyperparameter Tuning for Neural Network 

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (Hyperparameter_Tuning_for_NN.ipynb) that develops and optimizes a neural network model to predict diabetes outcomes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. The project focuses on hyperparameter tuning, regularization, dropout layers, and early stopping to enhance model performance.

## Features

Hyperparameters: Experiments with learning rate, batch size, and optimizer selection.
Regularization: Implementation of L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
Dropout Layers: Addition of dropout to improve model generalization.
Early Stopping: Use of early stopping to halt training and retain the best model weights.

## Installation

Clone the repository:
bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/hyperparameter-tuning-nn.git
cd hyperparameter-tuning-nn

Install dependencies:
bashpip install -r requirements.txt

Download the dataset:
