# 🔧 Hyperparameter Tuning for Neural Networks

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on exploring hyperparameter tuning techniques for improving the performance of neural networks. It utilizes `Keras` and `TensorFlow`, along with tuning tools such as `KerasTuner`, to find optimal configurations for building and training deep learning models.

## 📘 Overview

Hyperparameter tuning is a crucial step in developing robust and high-performing deep learning models. In this notebook, we:

- Build a baseline neural network model using Keras
- Tune model architecture and training parameters using **Keras Tuner**
- Evaluate performance using validation accuracy
- Visualize results to analyze the impact of different hyperparameter combinations

## 📁 Files

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- KerasTuner  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

## 🚀 Getting Started

🔍 Key Concepts Covered
Hyperparameter tuning with Keras Tuner
Using RandomSearch and Hyperband for optimization
Monitoring validation loss and accuracy
Model evaluation and visualization

📈 Results
The best-performing hyperparameter configurations are selected and the model is evaluated based on validation accuracy. Visualization charts help interpret how changes in learning rate, layer size, and number of layers impact model performance.

📌 Future Work
Expand tuning to include batch size, activation functions, and optimizers
Use Bayesian Optimization and other search strategies
Apply to more complex datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, IMDB)
